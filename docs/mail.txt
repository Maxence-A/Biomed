Hello everyone,

Here is a link to get the slides and the two papers we talked about:
https://filesender.renater.fr/?s=download&token=dd8384e8-023f-4469-87de-1ed36b6fe6ed

You are expected to form groups of two students and choose one of the following topics:

    Peptide toxicity prediction <-- ce projet on le regarde pas on ne l'utilise pas jamais 

    Protein subcellular localization <-- c'est ceux projet qu'il faut faire

The objective of the project is to carefully study the corresponding article and re-implement the proposed method using protein language model (pLM) embeddings, while designing a different deep learning architecture from the one used in the paper.

You must use both embeddings:

    ESM-C

    ProstT5 3Di

You should use the same input dataset as in the original paper, but all other components (model architecture, training procedure, evaluation pipeline) must be implemented from scratch by your group.


We also include in the link a related project from our team, where the same two embeddings were used for a different downstream task. The corresponding paper is provided, and the code is available on GitHub and Colab. You may consult it for inspiration and implementation ideas.



For the final report, you are expected to:

    Clearly describe your model architecture and design choices

    Explain how and why you combined the two embeddings

    Present and analyze your results

    Compare your performance with that reported in the original paper, using the same benchmark and evaluation metrics

    Discuss possible reasons why your results are better, similar, or worse

The main objectives of this project are to:

    Make well-justified and explainable methodological choices

    Avoid data leakage

    Properly handle class imbalance

Do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

The deadline for the project is February 13th by the end of the day.

Best regards,
Yasaman KARAMI
